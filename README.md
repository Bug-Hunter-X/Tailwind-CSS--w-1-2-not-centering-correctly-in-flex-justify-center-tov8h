# Tailwind CSS: w-1/2 Not Centering Correctly in flex justify-center

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where using `w-1/2` within a `flex justify-center` container doesn't always center the element horizontally as expected.  This is particularly noticeable in more complex layouts or when the parent container has specific dimensions or styles applied.

The `bug.js` file shows the issue. The `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution.

## Bug Explanation

The expected behavior is for the inner div with `w-1/2` to take up half the width of its parent and be centered horizontally because of `justify-center`.  However, under certain circumstances (e.g., parent container with specific width, presence of other flex items, or conflicting styles), this centering can fail.

## Solution

The issue might stem from implicit or unexpected widths on parent elements interfering with Tailwind's flexbox calculations. The solutions provided try to explicitly control the width of the parent container and apply the flexbox settings to ensure reliable centering.
